            <p>In the past, I've always done what I can when it comes to serving both my community and helping out any
                organizations I'm a part of. In high school, I was in marching band and participated in many activities
                including being a part of the load-crew and eventually become a section leader. I also helped out the
                color-guard and drum corps in setting up their shows and in</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">What I'm Doing</h1>
            <p>My Mother has a hobby of both taking care of chickens and gardening. I tend to help her out with these
                and since we almost always have a surplus of eggs and various fruits/vegetables, we donate these to
                local food-banks.</p>
            <p>Almost everything I create is because <b>A.</b> I'm interested in doing it and <b>B.</b> I feel like it
                would add value for the lives of both myself and others around me. For example, my discord bot was
                created to semi-moderate my discord server to take the load off of both me and my co-owner. Now, it also
                serves as a form of entertainment that me and my peers enjoy.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Future Commitments</h1>
            <p>In the future, I hope to do what I can to both help those in need and do my part for the greater good.
                Whether high or low impact, I hope that what I make changes or inspires at least one person's life.</p>
