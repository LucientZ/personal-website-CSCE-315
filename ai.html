                <p>Originally, this page was supposed to demonstrate the horrors of AI and why you shouldn't trust it.
                    However, what it managed to generate was actually quite interesting.

        <p class="ai-p">Created with the prompt: "Create a really cool html page that describes what you are along with
            some css
            animation" and "Can you also add some cool shapes at the bottom that are different colors and have their own

            <h2>What are Language Models?</h2>
            <p class="ai-p">Language models are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that are specifically
                designed to
                understand and generate human language text. They are a fundamental component of many natural language
                processing (NLP) tasks and applications.</p>
            <!-- You can continue to add more information about language models as needed. -->

            <!-- Cool shapes with animations -->
            <div class="shapes">
                <div class="shape"></div>
                <div class="shape"></div>

            <h1>Pushing AI to its limits</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Although what the AI generated was cool, it's pretty clear that there are some elements that are a
                    little odd. For example, the three circles at the bottom of its content overflow a little bit
                    because the AI didn't think to add any padding. Also, the animation applied to the AI Icon is doing
                    a very simple animation of simply spinning 360 degrees. A lot of these design concepts appear to be
                    simplistic because they're likely questions that people have asked on the internet that were given
                    simple answers.
                </p>
                <p>Despite the AI making some simple animations, I'm curious how far it can go. So I gave it the
                    following prompt: "With just CSS and HTML, create a professional Portfolio for yourself. Add a list
                    of projects with github links to each project. Format the information in a professional manner that
                    still gives some personality towards you"

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The second result is about what I was expecting originally. The text is white on a white background,
                    meaning it's pracitcally unreadable. What is interesting even though I said "you", it created a fake
                    person called "John Doe" to act as. I think the AI misunderstood that I was trying to create my own
                    website and it created it's own character to stand in as me. In the end, I think this more serves as
                    a tool for inspiration than a replacement for a web developer. This I am very glad about.</p>
                <p>In the end, this was a fun little experiment. Despite the AI not creating exactly what I had in my
                    head and there being some odd UI design choices, I feel like what it made was pretty decent.</p>
